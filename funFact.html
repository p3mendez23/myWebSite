/*************** Algorithm ******************
1. Make array that is filled with the subject topic
2. Make another array with corresponding fun facts to Topics
3. Must have function(start) and function(getindex) to be connected
4. You need a for loop to loop through var group once
5. You need that loop to acquire what element of group array was selected
6. You need the same corresponding element from facts array to be displayed as well
